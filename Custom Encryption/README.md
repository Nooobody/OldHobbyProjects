# Custom Encryption

My idea for an encryption. It takes a lot of space but I believe it's unbreakable without the codes.

Basically, it replaces every number and letter with a generated random pair made from numbers and letters.
And every single number and letter has around 80 possible pairs.

EncryptedFile.py generates the code-file, which the Encrypter and Decrypter uses.

# Lines of code: 119

The RNG I'm using here is a separate project of mine.
