# Mandelbrot

My Mandelbrot renderer made in Python. Supports Multithreading and infinite zoom only constrained by your processing power.
Scroll wheel allows you to go back in zooms, and it renders the one you're currently seeing. If it's done, it will render some other zoom level if any.

I added some samples that I recorded while using the renderer.
