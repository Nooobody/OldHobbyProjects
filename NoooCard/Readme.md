# Nooocard

A C++ project that I experimented with.

You click to create a spawner that then creates pixels around it indefinitely. Hold to create spawners wherever you move the cursor.
Tools exist to create spawners in geometrical shapes.

The "card" you've made can be saved and then loaded with the Loader.
The loader works by "redoing" every spawner in the exact order you made them, slowly. This creates the illusion that it's being drawn right now.
