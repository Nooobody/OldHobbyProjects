# Maze generation with A* Pathfinding

A C++ project that utilizes the A* algorithm for pathfinding and also generates a random maze.

The UI is not top-notch, apologies for that.

You first Generate the maze, then click the generate button again to stop it.
Then you click Solve and then click on a spot in the maze and it will find the closest path to it.
You will probably see a lot of red blocks, those are all of the nodes that the pathfinding algorithm checked, you can press the "Toggle rects" button to hide them and you will see the path more clearly.
