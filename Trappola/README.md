# Trappola

A gamemode made for the game Garry's Mod.

This is my second project ever and it uses a lot of different mechanics so I decided to feature it here.

It's an asymmetric game of fetch. You have a group of players who try to find balls around the map and bring them back to the spawn.
Meanwhile the other team, the "Trappers", are invisible ghosts and they have the ability to lay out traps anywhere on the map and the other team cannot see them.

It uses a lobby system that also has some minigames that I made in 2D, mainly Pac-man and my version of Space invaders.
