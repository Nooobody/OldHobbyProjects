# Spaceage -Reloaded-

A gamemode made for the game Garry's Mod.

This is a remaster from an older gamemode that no longer exists.
It uses a lot of the same mechanics with different implementations.

The idea of the game is to expand on the core Sandbox game, add space and planets, and also some asteroids in space.
You build a spaceship to mine the asteroids, then bring the mined resources to a space station to sell them and use the money to upgrade your spaceship.

The server that had this gamemode originally is where I learned how to code, so this is sort of a homage to that server.
